  <header>Avatar and Korra: Is the Sequel Overhated?</header>
  <p>I really enjoyed rewatching Avatar: The Last Airbender last summer, and ever since I've taken a pretty significant interest in the show. 
    I've read the graphic novels, bought the DVD set and some other items, and rewatched basically every episode, some maybe 10 times.
    As to why I enjoy the show so much, I think it's mainly the powerful and well-developed plot and the characters. I think the plot is really compelling, 
  and despite the universe of the show being very different from our reality, the characters and their actions manage to be relateable, believable, and profound at times. 
  The characters are definitely the best part of the show. There's 1 or 2 characters that almost every fan loves, while the rest of the characters are all well-liked 
  and up for debate as to which are better. My interest page for Avatar examines the similarities and differences between Avatar and its sequel, Legends of Korra.
  Many fans have said that the sequel does not nearly live up to the original, but I disagree.</p>
