      <p>I do think, in most respects, that Korra is the &#39;better&#39; show, incorprating both the strengths of a &#39;kid&#39;s show&#39; like Avatar in addition to the complex real-world themes of shows meant for adults. Nonetheless, whenever I&#39;m in the mood to once again immerse myself in the Avatar universe, I&#39;ll rewatch an episode from the original instead of the sequel 100 out of 100 times. Whether I&#39;m happy and excited to rewatch the series finale, sad and in need of &#39;Tales of Ba Sing Se&#39;, or just chilling with &#39;The Avatar and the Firelord&#39;,  there&#39;s an episode for basically every mood, even after I&#39;ve watched them more than eight times.</p>

      <p>  So why do I have a preference for the original when rewatching? Well, my best guess is that the sequel is much more plot-driven, and it doesn&#39;t have as many &#39;filler&#39; episodes. It&#39;s more like a modern show, and while the emphasis on plot really strengthens the prescense of the major themes while also really making the show a real pleasure to binge, it doesn&#39;t allow many episodes to truly stand out on their own. On the other hand, the abscense of significant plot in many Avatar episodes actually seems to have given the creators significantly more possibilities, which then allows them to get really creative in order to show character development and produce memorable moments in creative ways. &#39;Tales of Ba Sing Se&#39;, for example, has no significant contribution to the overarching plot — it is, in every way, a filler episode. &#39;Zuko Alone&#39; is a similar example that doesn&#39;t contribute to the plot at all. Yet these two consistently rank in fan&#39;s top five episodes of the whole series because of how they developed the characters (especially for Zuko in &#39;Zuko Alone&#39;), and how they are remembered by fans. &#39;Tales of Iroh&#39; is one of the saddest things I&#39;ve ever watched, and it humanizes Iroh and sets him apart from the cutthroat, evil Fire Nation of which he is (technically) still a part! &#39;Zuko Alone&#39; is all about character building. What happens to Zuko when he&#39;s all alone on his journey, with no Avatar in sight, no pressure to restore his honor, and just a dirt path and some tumbleweeds in a very Western-style story setting? Well, we see him try to deny his identity as a disgraced Fire Nation prince, but ends up understanding that that will forever be a part of who he is. And that&#39;s the key — you may be ashamed from it, you may walk away from it, but you shouldn&#39;t deny an experience&#39;s belonging in your life story. Only by accepting it — or perhaps even embracing it — can you move on to improve yourself. It&#39;s episodes like these that really do make Avatar such a memorable and cherished show.</p>
